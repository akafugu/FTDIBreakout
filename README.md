The FTDI Adapter is a breakout board for the FTD232R serial to USB
converter chip. It can be used to add serial communication via USB
to any microchip with an UART. It is also used as a programming
adapter for Arduino compatible boards that do not have an onboard FTDI
chip, such as the Arduino Pro and the
